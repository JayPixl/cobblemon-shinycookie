# Cobblemon: Shiny Cookie 🍪✨
A lightweight Cobblemon addon that allows you to turn your favorite Cobblemon shiny!
## New Items
- Stardust - Awarded when you catch wild shiny Cobblemon (amount configurable). Used as a seasoning for Star Cookies to increase the chance that the Cobblemon will be turned shiny!
- Star Cookie - Cooked in the Campfire Pot using Hearty Grains, Sugar, and Glow Berries. Feed it to a Cobblemon in your party for a chance to turn it shiny!
- Burnt Star Cookie - When fed to a Pokemon, it will reduce friendship and remove shiny status from a Cobblemon but give you one Stardust. Obtained by cooking a Star Cookie in a furnace.
